# HackRunningGo-SC
PC can run without legs. ðŸ˜Ž

## Description

This python script can help you to add Running Records for your personal information. And the running route is so reasonable because we change others running route and recode.

**The `feature` banch is used to build full functionality!**

## Declaration

This project is not for profit, so our organization choose **opensource** for it. 
We hope our school to make a better app, it includes **encrypted transmission information**, **use tokens for authentication**, **irreversible encryption account password** and **more secure network interface**. We sincerely hope that the school software technology is getting better and better, and it is not like this. ðŸ˜“

**So if you are like a ðŸ’©, we will fuck it. Thx.**

## Operating environment

You need to install `python 2.7`. 
And we recommend you to use `terminal` or `bash` in Linux, `item` in macOS and `powershell` in Windows.

## Dependencies

1. requests(A HTTP library for python)

## About app.conf

We use json string to configure this app. And notice that every time you modifed device_model, mac_address or imei, you need reset customDeviceId and deviceId to a empty string. The application will re-caculate it.

1. device_model: The phone's model you want to use to upload your record.
2. mac_address: The phone's mac address you want to use to upload your record.
3. imei: The phone's imei you want to use to upload your record.
4. startLatLng: We use it to get test points like a seed. You better change it to the geo coordinate of your school.
