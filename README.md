# HackRunningGo-SC
PC can run without legs. ðŸ˜Ž

## Description

This python script can help you to add Running Records for your personal information. And the running route is so reasonable because we change others running route and recode.

## Fork Description

Some universities will score students' PE class based on the record of this application.

Therefore,I add a simple feature,which will allow you to add history running records.

You can add history running records by a single day as well as a specific timezone.

Have fun!
