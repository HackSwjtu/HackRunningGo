# HackRunningGo-SC
PC can run without legs. ðŸ˜Ž

## Description

This python script can help you to add Running Records for your personal information. And the running route is so reasonable because we change others running route and recode.

## Fork Description

Some universities will score students' PE class based on the record of this application.

Therefore,I add a simple feature,which will allow you to add history running records.

You can add history running records by a single day as well as a specific timezone.

Have fun!

## Declaration

This project is not for profit, so our organization choose **opensource** for it. 
We hope our school to make a better app, it includes **encrypted transmission information**, **use tokens for authentication**, **irreversible encryption account password** and **more secure network interface**. We sincerely hope that the school software technology is getting better and better, and it is not like this. ðŸ˜“

**So if you are like a ðŸ’©, we will fuck it. Thx.**

## Operating environment

You need to install `python 2.7`. 
And we recommend you to use `terminal` or `bash` in Linux, `item` in macOS and `powershell` in Windows.

## Flow

### 1. Clone these repo(need git installed) or download the zip.

#### a.Clone the repo.

You need to deploy environment. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HackSwjtu/HackRunningGo-SC.git 
cd HackRunningGo-SC
```

#### b.Download the zip.

After download the zip,you need decompression it,and cd this dictionary.

### 2. Input your login id and password

Write your profile `id` and `password` to `user.data`.

```bash

#### e.g

![](/screenshot/ss2.png)

Or you can also find `user.data` file and open it with notepad.Then write your `id` and `password` to it(support multiple users,one line for one user.).


### 3. Update running route static data. (optional)

You can run following command code to update the static running route data. It will update these files: `route.data` and `tp.data`.

```bash
python updateRoutes.py
```


### 4. Let's run! Hacking!

Run `HaRunGo.py`, and be happy! 

```bash
python HaRunGo.py
```

You need to install `python 2.7`. 
And we recommend you to use `terminal` or `bash` in Linux, `item` in macOS and `powershell` in Windows.

## Dependencies

1. requests(A HTTP library for python)

## About app.conf

We use json string to configure this app. And notice that every time you modifed device_model, mac_address or imei, you need reset customDeviceId and deviceId to a empty string. The application will re-caculate it.

1. device_model: The phone's model you want to use to upload your record.
2. mac_address: The phone's mac address you want to use to upload your record.
3. imei: The phone's imei you want to use to upload your record.
4. startLatLng: We use it to get test points like a seed. You better change it to the geo coordinate of your school.
